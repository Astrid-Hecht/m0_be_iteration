# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
  * I think I get it, doing both examples helped me nail it down. At first I didnt't realize that the
  #{x} only happens inside of a string, so thats good to know now.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
  * It took much longer but I also feel like I learned much more! Productive struggle all the way!
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
  * Like most of these concepts I'm feeling pretty confident in my knowledge, I feel like they'll become instinct after a while.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
  * Can the hash bracket be used in any string to include a variable in the text? I'll google it.
